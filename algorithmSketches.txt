-- To add a new node (a) to an existing network
node (b) in network listens
new node connects to listening node's IP
b tells every directly connected node a list of its connected nodes
b tells a its view

-- When a node dies
every connected node known which nodes were connected
every node connects directly to previously connected node with highest value (IP, id, or whatever, as long as they agree)
    node with highest value knows that it is, and starts listening (it knows how many times)
    everyone else connects

-- To send a TextEvent
Send to every connected node

-- When receiving any Event
if (I was the creator)
    disconnect from sender
else
    send to every connected node except sender

-- To update everyone's view
Someone sends a special object containing the text for everyone to set (how to determine who?)
When received, send to every connected node except the sender

-- To add a network to another network (one will be the dominant regarding view)
A node (a) in one network listens
A node (b) in other network connects
node a sends update view to node b

-- When too many nodes are connected to one node (a)
a disconnects from half of the nodes (must not be the one with highest value)
disconnected nodes act as if a has died, and connects to the on with the highest value
